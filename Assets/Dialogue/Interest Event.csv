SAY.Interest Event.77.,,[今天，你如往常一样离开家中，打算前往店铺进行开店的准备],"[Today, as usual, you leave your home, planning to head to the shop to prepare for opening.]"
SAY.Interest Event.78.,,[走到门口时，你忽然看到那个黑衣人低着头站在你家门口],"[As you reach the door, you suddenly see the mysterious person from before, standing at your doorstep with their head lowered.]"
SAY.Interest Event.79.我,,(他来干什么？离约定的还款日期不是还有一段时间吗？),(What is he doing here? Isn't there still some time left until the agreed repayment date?)
SAY.Interest Event.81.,,[似乎是察觉到了你的视线，黑衣人抬起头来，向你走来],"[Seemingly noticing your gaze, the man in black raises his head and walks towards you.]"
SAY.Interest Event.82.我,,袁小姐你好，好久不见了。,"Hello, Miss Yuan. It's been a long time."
SAY.Interest Event.83.我,,但我可是一点都不想看到你，先生。,"But I must say, I didn't wish to see you at all, sir."
SAY.Interest Event.84.我,,距离我们约定的日期还有三周吧，你今天来是做什么？,There are still three weeks until our agreed date. What brings you here today?
SAY.Interest Event.85.黑衣人,,您可真是毫不留情啊。,"You really don't mince words, do you?"
SAY.Interest Event.86.黑衣人,,算了，让我们进入正题吧。,"Let's cut to the chase, then."
SAY.Interest Event.87.黑衣人,,不知道袁小姐是否知道您的父亲在向我们借款时，曾经跟我们约定每个星期要向我们支付一些利息这件事？,"Miss Yuan, are you aware that when your father borrowed money from us, he agreed to pay us some interest every week?"
SAY.Interest Event.88.我,,这又是什么时候的事情? 我可没在之前的合同上看到有这一项。,When did this happen? I didn't see this clause in the contract before.
SAY.Interest Event.89.黑衣人,,抱歉袁小姐，按照我们公司的规定，关于利息的部分，我们是写在另一份合同的上的。,"I'm sorry, Miss Yuan. According to our company's policy, the part about the interest is written in another contract."
\n,,,
SAY.Interest Event.90.黑衣人,,如果您不相信，我现在可以给您看看这份合同，上面还有您父亲的签名。,"If you don't believe me, I can show you the contract right now, which also has your father's signature on it."
\n\n,,,
SAY.Interest Event.91.,,[说完，黑衣人从包中掏出一份合同递给你]\n\n,"[Having said that, the man in black takes out a contract from his bag and hands it to you.]"
SAY.Interest Event.92.,,[你接过合同一看，上面确实约定了每周支付，还有父亲的签名]\n\n,"[You take the contract and see that it indeed stipulates weekly payments, complete with your father's signature.]"
SAY.Interest Event.93.,,[你仔细看了看约定支付的金额，上面赫然写着每周一万元]\n\n,"[You carefully check the amount agreed upon for the payments, and it shockingly states ten thousand yuan per week.]"
SAY.Interest Event.94.我,,每周一万元？你们这利息是怎么算的，怎么能这么多？,Ten thousand yuan per week? How do you calculate your interest? How can it be so much?
SAY.Interest Event.95.我,,而且这么高的利息合法吗？,And is such high interest even legal?
SAY.Interest Event.96.黑衣人,,冷静点袁小姐，这些利息是我们当时和您父亲一起商量好的，您父亲也同意了。,"Calm down, Miss Yuan. These interest rates were discussed and agreed upon with your father at the time, and he consented to them."
SAY.Interest Event.97.黑衣人,,而且这份利息的合同并不是以借款的利息为名义签署的。,"Moreover, this interest contract was not signed under the guise of being a loan interest agreement."
SAY.Interest Event.98.黑衣人,,这是一份您父亲单方面向我们支付的合同。,This is a contract for payments made unilaterally by your father to us.
SAY.Interest Event.99.我,,你们这不是钻法律空子吗？,Aren't you just exploiting legal loopholes?
SAY.Interest Event.100.黑衣人,,我个人更喜欢称呼这为法律的灰色地带，这并不违法不是吗？,"I personally prefer to refer to it as a legal gray area, which isn't illegal, right?"
SAY.Interest Event.101.黑衣人,,况且当初签订合约时，您的父亲也同意了。,"Moreover, your father agreed to it when the contract was initially signed."
SAY.Interest Event.102.黑衣人,,当然，如果您也可以选择让我们收走抵押物，也就是那所店铺。,"Of course, you also have the option to let us take the collateral, which is the shop."
SAY.Interest Event.103.黑衣人,,这样不用说利息了，连本金您都不用还了。,"This way, you won't have to talk about interest, and you won't even have to repay the principal."
SAY.Interest Event.104.黑衣人,,这听上去很划算吧。,"That sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?"
SAY.Interest Event.105.黑衣人,,要知道现在这个城市早就不是当年的那个城市了。这店铺早就不值这么多钱了。,You should know that this city is no longer what it was back then. That shop is no longer worth that much money.
SAY.Interest Event.106.黑衣人,,这样您也可以告别这个伤心的地方，重新开始新的生活。,"This way, you can also say goodbye to this place of sorrow and start a new life."
SAY.Interest Event.107.黑衣人,,这对您来说应该是最好的选择。,This should be the best option for you.
SAY.Interest Event.108.我,,为什么你们对于我们家的店铺那么执着？,Why are you so persistent about our family's shop?
SAY.Interest Event.109.我,,照你所说，如果我们家的店铺真的不值钱，那你们为什么一直要引诱我放弃它？,"According to you, if our family's shop really isn't worth much, then why do you keep trying to persuade me to give it up?"
SAY.Interest Event.110.我,,说到底这件事情从一开始就很奇怪。,"At the end of the day, this whole situation has been strange from the beginning."
SAY.Interest Event.111.我,,父亲他一向沉稳，怎么可能借这么大一笔钱从来不让我知道。,My father has always been prudent. How could he possibly borrow such a large sum of money and never let me know about it?
SAY.Interest Event.112.我,,我很难不怀疑这件事背后有什么问题,It's hard for me not to suspect there's something wrong behind all this.
SAY.Interest Event.113.黑衣人,,您这就是血口喷人了，这些问题您应该去询问您的父亲，而不是我。,"You're making baseless accusations. These are questions you should have asked your father, not me."
SAY.Interest Event.114.黑衣人,,况且，现在的问题是这些吗？您应该想想您是否能还上这笔利息。,"Besides, is that the issue at hand? You should be considering whether you can afford to pay this interest."
SAY.Interest Event.115.我,,(他的情绪明显不对劲，这背后肯定有什么我不知道的事情）,(His demeanor is clearly off. There must be something going on behind the scenes that I don't know about.)
SAY.Interest Event.117.我,,(我不能随他的心意，他越是想要店铺我越不能给他),"(I can't just follow his will. The more he wants the shop, the less I can give it to him.)"
SAY.Interest Event.116.我,,(但是他说的是对的，如果我把店铺给他，我也可以借此机会重新回到之前的生活）,"(But he's right. If I give him the shop, I can also seize this opportunity to return to my previous life.)"

SAY.Interest Event.125.我,,[说完你打开手机，准备开始转账],"[After speaking, you open your phone, ready to start the transfer.]"
SAY.Interest Event.127.我,,(坏了，我居然忘了我现在没有一万块）,"(Uh-oh, I forgot I don't have ten thousand right now.)"
SAY.Interest Event.128.,,[你讪讪的抬起头],[You sheepishly raise your head.]
SAY.Interest Event.129.我,,我能不能晚点把这笔钱给你,Can I give you the money later?
SAY.Interest Event.130.黑衣人,,抱歉，袁小姐。合同规定好了，您需要今天支付这笔钱。,"I'm sorry, Miss Yuan. It's specified in the contract that you need to pay this amount today."
SAY.Interest Event.131.黑衣人,,如果您没有钱支付，按照合同，我们就要收走您的店铺。,"If you don't have the money to pay, according to the contract, we'll have to take possession of your shop."

SAY.Interest Event.141.我,,我把钱转过去了，你看看吧。,I've transferred the money. Take a look.
SAY.Interest Event.142.,,[或许是没想到你真的能掏出钱，黑衣人神色上有些诧异],"[Perhaps not expecting you to actually produce the money, the man in black looks somewhat surprised.]"
SAY.Interest Event.143.黑衣人,,很好袁小姐，您真是个有能力的人。,"Very well, Miss Yuan. You're truly capable."

SAY.Interest Event.145.,,[说完，黑衣人头也不回的离开了],"[After saying that, the man in black leaves without looking back.]"
